                <h3>The Business Situation</h3>
                <p>In 2023, sticky.io faced a critical challenge: payment failures were creating massive involuntary churn, costing millions in revenue. Traditional rule-based payment systems couldn't adapt to sophisticated fraud patterns, declined legitimate transactions, and provided poor customer experiences during payment failures.</p>

                <h3>Why This Problem Mattered</h3>
                <p>With sticky.io processing over $100M annually in subscription payments, even small improvements in payment success rates translated to massive revenue impact. More critically, involuntary churn was destroying customer relationships—subscribers whose payments failed often never returned, regardless of product satisfaction.</p>

                <h3>Key Constraints</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> PCI DSS Level 1 and GDPR requirements limiting data access and processing approaches</li>
                    <li><strong>Legacy Infrastructure:</strong> Monolithic payment system with 99.9% uptime requirements during transformation</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Trust:</strong> Payment failures had created negative brand perception requiring careful UX redesign</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Debt:</strong> 5+ years of accumulated payment logic making changes risky and time-intensive</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>My Role and Leadership Scope</h3>
                <p>As VP of Product, UX, and Data, I had full P&L accountability for sticky.io's $44M revenue stream. I led a 12-person cross-functional team including data scientists, UX designers, engineers, and payment specialists, reporting directly to the CEO with board-level visibility on transformation outcomes.</p>

                <h3>Strategic Framework: Trust-First Transformation</h3>

                <h3>What Worked</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Customer-Centric AI:</strong> Starting with customer pain points before technical solutions ensured AI served real needs</li>

                        <h4>🤖 AI + Empathy</h4>
                        <p>Most powerful AI applications combine technical sophistication with deep human understanding. Technology alone doesn't build trust—experience design does.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="lesson-item">
                        <h4>📈 Metrics + Stories</h4>
                        <p>While quantitative results ($15M revenue) secure executive support, qualitative customer stories drive team motivation and product iteration.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="lesson-item">
                        <h4>🔒 Privacy + Performance</h4>
                        <p>Privacy constraints force creative technical solutions that often result in better, more robust systems than unconstrained approaches.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>How It Shaped My Approach</h3>
                <p>This experience reinforced my belief that breakthrough product innovation happens at the intersection of advanced technology and deep customer empathy. Pure technical optimization misses emotional dimensions that drive real business outcomes.</p>

                <p>The 74% NPS improvement taught me that customer perception of product value often depends more on how technology makes them feel than what it technically accomplishes. I now start every AI/ML project by understanding the emotional journey, not just the technical requirements.</p>

                <p>Most importantly, this project demonstrated that sustainable competitive advantage comes from integrated capabilities (AI + UX + compliance) that competitors cannot easily replicate, rather than point solutions that can be copied.</p>
